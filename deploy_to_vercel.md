# Vercel Deployment Instructions

We've completed all the necessary code changes to fix the Vercel deployment. Here's what we've done:

1. Created a lightweight app version in `app_vercel.py` that doesn't depend on heavy libraries
2. Created a minimal `requirements-vercel.txt` with only essential dependencies
3. Updated `vercel.json` to use these optimized files

## Manual Push Instructions

Due to terminal session issues, here's how to push the changes:

1. Open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\disha\OneDrive\Desktop\AI_MODEL
   ```
3. Run this command to push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push suswasthyam master
   ```

## What Will Happen Next

Once you push the changes:

1. Vercel will detect the update to your GitHub repository
2. It will rebuild your application using the lightweight version
3. The deployment should succeed because we've eliminated the heavy dependencies

## How This Fixes the Size Limit Issue

The size limitation in Vercel (250MB max) is addressed by:

1. Using only minimal dependencies (Flask, NumPy, and a few others)
2. Creating a special lite version of the app without pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, or TensorFlow
3. Implementing a simplified anomaly detection algorithm that works without these large libraries

## Checking Deployment Success

Once deployed, visit:

- Main app: https://suswasthyam.vercel.app/
- Health check: https://suswasthyam.vercel.app/api/health
