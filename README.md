# Adaptive Health Prediction Model

This project implements an adaptive machine learning model that predicts health outcomes based on vital signs data (temperature, SpO2, and heart rate) over time intervals.

## Features

- **Self-improving model**: Trains on initial data and continuously fine-tunes as new data arrives
- **Time-series analysis**: Considers temporal patterns in vital signs
- **Multiple prediction formats**: Can predict future values or health status classifications
- **Evaluation metrics**: Tracks model performance over time

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare your initial dataset in CSV format with columns for timestamp, temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and target variable

3. Run initial training:

   ```
   python train.py --data_path your_initial_data.csv
   ```

4. Make predictions:

   ```
   python predict.py --input your_test_data.csv
   ```

5. Fine-tune with new data:
   ```
   python train.py --data_path new_data.csv --fine_tune
   ```
